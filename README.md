# Typescript Starter with Webpack

## Description

My main objective on this repo is to have a clean base to start coding frontend in Typescript without bindings to any framework. It's a good starting point to write frontend libraries.

Main features:

- Uses webpack
- You can development in ES2020 :tada:
- Transpiled to es5 (maximizing compatibility)
- Dotenv
- Checking format of commit messages
- Automatic changelog
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Checking on pre commit phase
- editorconfig
- Watcher

More to come:

- Tests setup
- Checking of tests before push
  ...

## Installation

```
npm i
```

## Usage

Add your code in src and just run:

```
npm run build
```

To generate a bundle in dist folder.

Set NODE_ENV=production to create an uglified & optimized version
Set NODE_ENV=development to generate a version with sourcemaps
